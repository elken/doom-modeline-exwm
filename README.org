Simple [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] segment to display information about the current EXWM workspace layout, including workspaces which have X windows on and which are marked as "urgent" by a client.

[[file:.github/demo.png]]

In the above example:
- Workspace 1 is the current workspace
- Workspaces 2-4 are inactive workspaces that have X windows associated with them
- Workspace 5 is a fully inactive workspace. 

Due to the usage of built-in exwm functions, there should be no issue with the amount of workspaces; although there's no built-in space limit so one should bear that in mind for say more than 5 or so workspaces.
